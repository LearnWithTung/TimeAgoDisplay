## Implement a `timeAgoDisplay` method using TDD method

### What we gonna get  ?
- a helper function which returns formatted string as you might see everywhere on social media apps. For example: `a day ago`, `2 weeks ago`, ...
extension Date {
    func timeAgoDisplay() -> String {
        // implement here...
    }
}

### Why ?
Well, the logic actually pretty simple but the process is more important in this case. I follow TDD process by implement step by step (check out my commits), you can try by your own as practice and then check mine.

Thanks !
