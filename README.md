## Implement a `timeAgoDisplay` method using TDD method

### What we gonna get  ?
a helper function which returns formatted string as you might see everywhere on social media apps For example: `a day ago`, `2 weeks ago`, ...

### Why ?
Well, the logic actually pretty simple but the process is more important in this case. I follow TDD process to build it, you can try by your own as practice and then check mine.

Thanks !
